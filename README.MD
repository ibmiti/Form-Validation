<!-- HTML5 adds some attributes that allow form validation. For example, the required attributes can be added to an input field to make it mandatory to fill in.
More complex form validation can be done using Javascript.
The form element has an onsubmit event that can be handled to perform validation.
For example, lets create a form with two inputs and one button. the text in both fields should be the same and not blank to pass the validation. -->
